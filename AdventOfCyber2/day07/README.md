Wireshark is capable of recording a log of all the packets sent and received on a computer's network adapter. For example, we can see how a computer (highlighted in red) connected to a computer (highlighted in black) that was running a web server via HTTP, in this case, it was the web page: web_server/download.HTML, which we can export and view for ourselves.
